# AkkaHttp_Assignment

This project is all about user management system with crud operation but the difference is instead of calling methods I pass messages between actors.(For Database Repo you can use method calling) Replace data storage with MySQL and use the SLICK library for database interaction. Create REST APIs for all CRUD operations using Akka HTTP.

For Running apis use POSTMAN
